# Feel free to comment out your code for other Parts youâ€™re not currently working on.
# A quick way to comment out a lot of code is to select the lines and press Ctrl(Cmd) + /

###
### Part 1: isOdd
###

# create a function that has one input, num, called isOdd
# the function returns a boolean as to whether or not num is odd
# hint: think about what it means for a number to be even
# hint: the modulo is useful for checking

###
### Part 2: CHONK Chart
###

# have the user enter a positive weight (pounds) of their (imaginary) cat
# create a variable to store the rating of the input using this chart https://i.redd.it/am6cna8huen11.png (the large bold numbers are pounds)
# print out the result in this format:
#   Your cat is rated _
# tip: double check the order of your conditions and whether you use < or >, 
#      or you may find that your result ends up being the same every time

###
### Part 3: coordinatePosition
###

# create a function that has two inputs x, and y, called coordinatePosition
# the function returns a a string 'N','S','E','W','NE','SE','NW','SW', or 'C' based on the position of x and y relative to the origin (0,0) on a Cartesian Plane
# the function returns 'C' if both x and y as ints both equal 0
#   a.k.a. if x and y both are less than 1, it's close enough to be counted as 'C' 
# the function returns 'N','S','E', or 'W' if the corresponding x or y as int equal 0
#   for example, coordinatePosition(-0.19, 19) returns 'N' since int(-0.19) == 0 in the x direction
# the function returns 'NE','SE','NW', or 'SW' otherwise based on the coordinates
# hint: remember the logical operators "and" and "or"
