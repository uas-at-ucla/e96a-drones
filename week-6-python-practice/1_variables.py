### E96A: Drones
### Week 6 Python Practice
### Variables

# Feel free to comment out your code for other Parts youâ€™re not currently working on.
# A quick way to comment out a lot of code is to select the lines and press Ctrl(Cmd) + /

###
### Part 0: Hello World
###

# before we do anything else, we must start with the classic
# using the print() function, display "Hello, World!"

# TODO: your code goes here

###
### Part 1: Greetings
###

# 1. using the input() function, have the user enter their name into a variable called m_name
# 2. then, print out a greeting with the name, such as "Hello there, General Kenobi, you are a bold one!" (user input "General Kenobi")
# hint: remember string concatenation

###
### Part 2: Circles
###

# 1. create a variable called m_pi, with an approximation of pi (3.1415 or something)
# 2. using the input() function, have the user enter a radius length (int or float) into a variable named m_radius
# 3. then create two new variables, m_circumference and m_area 
# and calculate the respective circumference and area
# 4. print out the results in this format using only one print() statement:
#   For a circle with radius #,
#   Circumference = #
#   Area = #
# hint: remember to convert the input string to a float using float() to perform the calculation
# hint: remember to convert the number to a string using str() to print and use the new line escape character!

### Part 3: Spare Change
###

# 1. have the user enter a monetary value (float, but with at most 2 decimal places) greater than 1 into a variable named m_change
# 2. calculate the minimum number of quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.1), nickels ($0.05), and pennies ($0.01) are needed to fulfill the change
# 3. print out the results in this format:
#   For a change of $#:
#   Quarters: #
#   Dimes: #
#   Nickels: #
#   Pennies: #
# tip: consider working in cents instead of dollar (i.e. multiplying by 100 and converting to int)
# hint: use integer (floored) division operator to get the number of coins
# hint: use the modulo (remainder) assignment operator to get remainder of m_change without the _ coins
#   for example, if there was a wack coin with value of $0.33
#       num_wack = m_change // 33       # working in cents, m_change already multiplied by 100 and converted to int
#       m_change %= 33                  # m_change now is the value left over with 33cent coins removed
