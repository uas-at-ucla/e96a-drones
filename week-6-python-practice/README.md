# Welcome to Python!
We've put together this assignment to help you get more familiar with Python, its syntax, and writing code!

## Getting started

### Didn't install Python or VS Code?
We have the same practice assignment on [Replit: Week 6 Python Practice](https://replit.com/@jtfa22/Week-6-Python-Practice)! Once you click the link, hit the big green Play triangle button to run the intro code (may take a couple seconds) that will show the instructions to get set up. 

*Remainder of this readme does not apply if you are only using Replit.*

### Get Code from Github
Aight, now it's just us cool coders here :P

You will want to download this entire repository (files of code). To do so, head back to the [repository landing page](https://github.com/uas-at-ucla/E96A-Drones) and click on the green "Code" button, and from the drop down menu, select Download ZIP, which is also conveniently linked [here](https://github.com/uas-at-ucla/E96A-Drones/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Once downloaded, unzip the file and place it somewhere to your liking.

## Getting started on Coding
Open up Visual Studios Code (or whichever IDE you installed) and open the downloaded folder from VS Code within. 

*VS Code might give you a bunch of Python Extension suggestions and what not for you to download, which you are free to, but not required.*

You should see all the 4 files in this assignment, for the different topics we've covered. We'd suggest working through them in order.

## Running the Code
To run the code of a file, just simply hit that green Play triangle button in the top right corner.
